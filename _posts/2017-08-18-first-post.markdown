title: Creating my Jekyll blog (again)
permalink: /blog/1
---

So a while ago, I used Jekyll to make a blog. I then proceeded to never used it so I replaced it with some html/css for a basic personal site with my resume, social media links, and a little about me. Then a couple days ago, I randomly (Nikita, you kinda inspired this) decided to remake it.

So here we are. Friday evening, writing about remaking a blog. What an exciting life I lead.

Obviously, I should make blogposts about interesting tech I work/find/play with. I am a software engineer after all, isn't that all I think aboout? The last time I tried that, though, I got burned out and didn't really write many posts. So I'll use this to write about whatever really pops into my head. It might get a little rant-y, fair warning.

Also the CSS to the site (as of today) isn't really finalized. I'll probably tweak it as I see fit.
